## Findings about forcing small weights with weight constraints

### Problem description

A binary classification problem is used to demonstrate the effect of weight constraints to reduce overfitting of a
model. Specifically, the problem has 2 input features and a dataset size of 100 with a noise of 0.2, which is contrived
using the scikit-learn `make_moons()` function.
